            <h1>Statue of Liberty</h1>
            <div class="inner3"><p>The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: La Liberté éclairant le monde) is a colossal neoclassical sculpture
                 on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York City, United States. The copper statue, a gift from the people of France, was designed by French sculptor
                  Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi 
                and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.The statue is
                 a figure of Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty. She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in 
                 her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776, in Roman numerals), the date of the 
                 U.S. Declaration of Independence. A broken chain and shackle lie at her feet as she walks forward, commemorating the na
                 tional abolition of slavery following the American Civil War.[8] After its dedication the statue became an icon of freedom 
                 and of the United States, 
                being subsequently seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea.</p></div>
